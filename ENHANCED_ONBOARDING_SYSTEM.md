# Enhanced Onboarding System - BioWell

## Overview

The enhanced onboarding system has been completely refined to successfully collect and save comprehensive user data for profile creation and future personalization. This system provides a robust, multi-step, user-friendly experience that captures detailed health, lifestyle, and preference information.

## Key Features

### 1. Multi-Step Onboarding Flow
- **8 Comprehensive Steps**: Personal Information, Health Goals, Physical Profile, Sleep & Recovery, Nutrition & Diet, Mental Health & Stress, Supplements & Medical, and Preferences
- **Progressive Data Collection**: Each step focuses on specific aspects of user health and lifestyle
- **Step Validation**: Real-time validation ensures data completeness and accuracy
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual progress indicators show completion status

### 2. Enhanced Data Structure
The `UserProfile` interface now includes:
- **Personal Information**: Name, email, mobile, date of birth, gender
- **Physical Metrics**: Height, weight, activity level, exercise preferences
